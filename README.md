# MERN Task Manager Codebase Assessment

Welcome to the MERN Task Manager Codebase Assessment! In this assessment, you will be tasked with improving the code quality, applying SOLID principles, and writing unit test cases for the existing MERN Task Manager application.

## Getting Started

To begin the assessment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```
   cd mern-task-manager
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Start the development server for both the client and server:

   ```
   # Start the client
   npm run client
   
   # Start the server
   npm run server
   ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the MERN Task Manager application.


## Changes:
1. Restructured the application by segmenting into client(react application) and server(express application).
2. Followed atomic structure to organize the components.
3. Maintained reusability and scalability. Added necessary comments/Todos for reference.
4. Implemented `Edit Feature` by exposing a `PATCH` route on BE and integrated the same on FE.
